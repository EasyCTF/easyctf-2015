Given a sentence in Pig Latin, reverse it and try to find the original English text.</p> <p>Be careful to note that if a Pig Latin word is capitalized, like &quot;Arispay&quot;, the original English word is &quot;Paris&quot; rather than &quot;pAris&quot;. Case counts!</p> <p>ID: <code>piglatin2</code><br /> Input: A sentence in Pig Latin.<br /> Output: The translation in English.</p> <p>Read the input from a file called&nbsp;<code>piglatin2.in</code>&nbsp;that&#39;s in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called&nbsp;<code>piglatin2.out</code></p>",
