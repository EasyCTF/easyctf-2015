	"description":	"<p>Use the programming interface to complete this task. You&#39;ll be given a math expression, such as <code>add 1 2</code> or <code>subtract 5 3</code>, where you will perform the operations <code>1+2</code> and <code>5-3</code>, respectively.</p> <p>ID:&nbsp;<code>math-class</code><br /> Input: An expression in the form of <code>operation operand1 operand2</code>, separated by spaces. Read input from <code>math-class.in</code>.<br /> Output: The <strong>absolute</strong> value of the evaluated&nbsp;expression. Your output should always be a positive integer.</p> <p>There are only 2 different possible operations, addition and subtraction, and all operands will be integer values between 1 and 1000. As always, remember to end your program with a newline.</p>",
	"hint":			"<p>Two very useful functions are <code>int()</code> and <code>split()</code>. Read about them in the documentation.</p>",
